              "After the pain left, I was scared! I could actually 'see' inside
              things and knew things I shouldn't!"
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="center no-indent">
            <strong> "Unknowingly I had become a Medical Intuitive." </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            What happened to me is typical for a Medical Intuitive. Forty plus
            years ago I stopped in the left hand turn lane for a red light. I
            glanced up just as the car behind struck my pickup. The police said
            the teen was going approximately 50 m.p.h. at impact. He told them
            that he thought he could beat the light, that he just didn't see me.
          </p>
          <p>
            My head flew forward into the windshield then snapped back into the
            rear window. The truck went up, came down, was struck again, causing
            my head to slam into the side window.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the pain eased, I was really scared! I could actually see
            inside things. I knew things a normal person couldn't know. I found
            that I could get rid of the pain people were in. I'd had no exposure
            to the metaphysical, new age world or quantum physics. I didn't
            understand what was going on.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my convalescence, I stayed with my parents so that my
            chiropractor father could treat me. As it happened, while sitting in
            his waiting room waiting for treatment, I realized that I knew what
            had happened to the woman sitting next to me and what she needed to
            have done to recover.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scared, I told my father what I heard. He wasn't scared. He was
            excited. He told me that her x-rays verified what I'd heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            He said that he'd read something about what I was describing. (This
            all took place long before home computers and the internet.) He'd
            read about men with abilities similar to what I was experiencing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edgar Cayce a psychic healer, Peter Hurkos a carpenter who turned
            psychic when he hit his head falling from a ladder, and Dr. Phineas
            Parkhurst Quimby who in the mid-1800's told his patients that he
            knew how to heal as Jesus did. It's recorded that he healed over
            38,000 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before then I don't think I'd ever heard the word psychic. As I
            found out more about these men, I compared their experiences to
            mine, I realized that I wasn't crazy or possessed. I was actually
            "seeing" inside bodies and "hearing" things.
          </p>

          <div class="section-seperator">
            <span>~</span>&nbsp;&bull;&bull;&bull;&nbsp;<span>~</span>
          </div>

          <p>
            At first it was difficult for me to explain what I was seeing. The
            fault was mine. At the time of the crash my life was simple. I was a
            working, owner-operator of a local bookstore with two children. I
            had learned in Chiroprac- tic College that the body will heal itself
            if it's given what it needs. However what I'd learned about biology,
            specifically physiology, was long forgotten.
          </p>

          <p class="center">
            <strong>
              As a Medical Intuitive my abilities go way beyond seeing what's
              wrong... I know what to do to fix what I see.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of the collision and my new abilities, I went back and
            relearned the name and function of our organs, glands, etc. and how
            they interact and function.
          </p>

          <h3 class="center text-maroon">Food as Medicine</h3>
          <p>
            I found that often our body just needs specific foods from the
            grocery store to heal. Foods act as medicine. When the body lacks
            the right quality and combination of foods it will weaken and get
            sick. When it gets the right quality and combination the body heals
            itself.

            Naoko was living in Tokyo when she sent an email with the hope we
            could help her. She was looking for a miracle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her life had become the four walls of her bedroom. She could not get
            out of bed. Both her legs were bent abnormally at the knee. They'd
            turned out in opposite directions. Looking down, she said her legs
            looked like a frog's.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sarah saw that she was being poisoned by canned foods. She advised
            her to stop eating anything if it came from a can. She was given a
            list of fresh foods and shipped certain supplements to get the
            poisons out of her body.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was 4 months before we heard from her again. She emailed to say
            "Thank you". She said it took her 3 months to get the poison out and
            her legs back.
          </p>
          <p>
            While bedridden she was able to support herself translating English
            books into Japanese for an author. Able to walk, she wrote that she
            was able to take the subway to and from her new higher paying job.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few months later she flew to California to meet me. Then three
            years after our visit, she flew to Canada to visit a cousin. She did
            not return to Japan. While on that visit she met and a Canadian
            gentleman. As far as I know Naoko is still well and happily married.

        <p>
          In the mid-1800's well over 38,000 were healed of their various
          aliments by Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802-1866). He claimed that
          he healed as Jesus did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set out to find out... First, if that were true. And, if it were
          true, how did he do it. And if he had, did he leave a way others could
          learn to do the same?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hundred's of newspaper articles and letters praised Dr. Quimby's
          method of treatment. Copies of these articles were donated to The
          Library of Congress as having historical value. On top of those
          articles, I gathered an extensive library on Quimby... included are
          some papers written in his own hand, excerpts, letters, patient files,
          testimonials and his philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a fact. Historical records do tell us that Dr. Quimby had indeed
          heal thousands.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually I learned how to heal as he did.</p>
        <p class="center no-indent text-maroon">
          <strong>
            A Quimby's Method recovery takes place within minutes &/or hours...
            not months or years.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          At 57 Quimby realized that he knew how Jesus healed. He opened an
          office in Portland, Maine. His results were astounding. According to
          the newspapers of his day, using no medicine, therapy or equipment,
          thousands were healed of conditions considered to be incurable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overwhelmed with patients, his adult son said that his father, Dr.
          Quimby died of overwork seven years after opening his office.
        </p>

        <div class="section-seperator">

        </div>

        <p>
          Quimby wrote that his foundation for healing was based upon knowing
          the truth. He left the following explanation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            "All disease, all discomfort <b>is the result of an opinion,</b> in
            essence, a lie individuals believe about themselves or their life.
            Find the lie for them, tell them the truth and you've given back
            their health. <b>The truth is always the cure.</b>"
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            "All disease, all discomfort, all the things you have going wrong in
            your life are the result of opinions."
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>- P. P. Quimby</p>
        <p>
          I studied and experimented for months before I fully understood what
          he Dr. Quimby meant. It seemed so far out in left-field.
        </p>
        <p>
          He meant that when we are unwell or unhappy, there was something that
          we started to believe about ourself that wasn't true.
        </p>

        <div class="section-seperator">

          When we realize the truth that belief will automatically dissolve and

          our health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look back at the word opinion. It's a keyword. It's the key to all
          that is going wrong in our life.

        <p>

          An Actual Demonstration of Quimby's Method
        </h3>
        <p>
          One hundred twenty-five doctors were given an opportunity to observe
          the dramatic results of Quimby's Method.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the result of a shower glass door accident, Lisa Franklin spent the
          evening in an a hospital emergency room. Her hand needed She required
          8 stitches. Lisa's husband was one of the professionals doctors
          scheduled to attend my demonstration the next day. He called to ask if
          his wife could be one of my demonstrations. She was in horrible pain.
          I told him that as long as she can remain drug free for the
          demonstration, I'd love to use her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following morning Lisa arrived pale from pain. Holding her hand up
          to avoid an increase of blood flow and even more pain, she was cupping
          her elbow. I asked her to come forward and sit on the tall bar stool
          placed at the front of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five of the doctors examined her hand. It was a puffy, red, swollen
          mass with four, thick black X's where the emergency room doctor had
          put stitches. Their conclusion:
          <i
            >Her hand was typical of one that had suffered a deep cut within the
            previous 18 hours.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I stood beside her so the audience could watch. Thirty minutes into
          the session, Lisa didn't seem to notice (but the audience did) that
          she'd put her hand down when she laughed. An hour later, still not
          touching her, I asked if her hand hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked bewildered, as if she'd forgotten why she was sitting in
          front of 125 people. At first she gently felt the area, then she poked
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What she did next surprised even me. She slammed her hand against the
          edge of the stool several times. Looking confused she said, "There's
          no pain. It doesn't hurt at all."
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctors re-examined her hand. There was no sign of an injury; just
          four black X's. The skin showed no sign that it had been pulled back
          together. No puffiness. No redness. No thin red line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Russell Loveland, a Chiropractor in practice for over twenty
          years, was in the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            "The first time that I heard there was someone who knew how to heal
            using logic alone, I knew they had something. After that
            demonstration, I realized that this method is the Lamborghini of
            Healing."
