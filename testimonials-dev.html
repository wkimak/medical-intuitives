          I still can't figure out how you -or should I say I- turned off the
          pain I'd lived with for over eight years. As you know, that pain made
          it impossible for me to continue working in heavy construction. It
          turned me into an invalid. The good news is that I'm back working
          full-time in construc-tion. Thank you doesn't seem enough in exchange
          for what you did for me and my family. But here it is... Thank you!

          Oh, My God! I can't believe what just happened to me. This is
          incredible. I don't hurt. My depression is GONE! And, it was so easy.
          And, to think last night I felt that I couldn't go on, that I needed
          to kill myself to end it all. For the first time in years, I feel in
          control of my life. Thank you sooooo much.

          big of me, but I really tried to be angry at her again and I couldn't.

          Yesterday Blackie, our 15 year old dog, was run over. After hours of
          tears my teen-age daughter suggested that the entire family 'Rub Up'
          so we'd could remember the good times and stop crying. Sometimes, I'm
          amazed by her. Well, we did it. It worked. Afterwards we sat around
          talking and laughing about some of his antics. Thank you.

          We decided to start Family Night with "Rub Up". The reason I'm writing
          is to tell you that I've noticed that we all get along much better
          since we started doing it to start Family Night. Thanks to you there
          are fewer arguments among the chil-dren. They seem happier. I know I
          am.

          Sarah you taught me how to 'Rub Up' nineteen years ago. It

          I recently had the pleasure of doing a session with Sarah Meredith ...
          and WOW!!!!! Her processes are simple yet powerful. She definitely has
          the missing piece of the puzzle. I feel like my life has finally come
          together. Sarah worked with me on something that would have had
          serious consequences had it not been resolved. I felt immediate
          results. <em>~Loretta Martin, Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist</em>

          "I love you! Yesterday my 3 year old was throwing his usual tantrum,
          on the floor kicking his heels, screaming at the top of his lungs
          because he couldn't go to school with is brother. Today, I sat on the
          floor and rubbed up and down his back as you suggested. It took less
          then 30 seconds. He stopped crying almost immediately, sniffled, then
          wormed his way off my lap as if nothing had happened. He picked up a
          toy and took off after the dog. A few minutes later I heard him
          gig-gling. What's amazing about this? EVERY MORNING FOR THE PAST THREE
          MONTHS, it took me about 15 to 20 minutes just to calm him down. I
          love you!!!"

          Two years after her Quimby's Method sessions, I asked Lydia for a
          testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I feel fantastic! My life has never been this good. My health has
          completely returned. Two weeks ago, on my 56th birth-day, I did a
          sixteen mile hike, up-hill and back! I did not get tired. A few days
          before the hike, I spent two days with a shovel, digging a drainage
          ditch. I thought for sure I'd be sore the next day. I wasn't. Not one
          muscle was sore. It's been over 2 years and I'm still symptom free. I
          love the new me."
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years later Lydia called. She'd had a flare-up. Forty minutes on
          the phone re-established her health. It's been over 30 years since we
          did that sessions. As far as I know she's still going strong.

        <h2 class="center">Naoko's Miracle</h2>
        <p>
          Naoko lived in Tokyo with her mother (her caretaker), when she sent an
          email hoping we could help her. She was look-ing for a miracle. Her
          life had become the four walls of her bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bedridden she was able to support herself translating Eng-lish books
          into Japanese. She could not get out of bed as both of her legs were
          bent abnormally at the knee. They'd turned out in opposite directions.
          She wrote that looking down at her legs was like looking a a frogs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I "saw" that she was being poisoned by canned foods. I advised her to
          stop eating anything that came from a can. I gave her a list of fresh
          foods for her mother to get and pre-pare.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hadn't heard from her for months when she e-mailed to say "Thank
          you". She wrote that it took three months to get the poisons out and
          have her legs fully straighten out. Once she was able to walk, she
          applied and got a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is spectacular to me what that in such short time she was able to
          not only have a job out of the house, but that she has to take the
          subway both ways during rush hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Update on Naoko:</em><br />A couple of years after her recovery
          she met a Canadian gentleman. Next I heard, she was moving to Canada
          as his wife.

          Jane was unable to work for five years because she had severe, low
          back pain. She was pale, worried and doubtful that we'd get rid of her
          pain. Her session was a little under an hour. We quickly found the
          decision causing her pain. Without prompting from me, she knew that
          the decision she'd made wasn't true. Without any more help from me,
          she knew the truth. Remember... The truth is the cure. In that moment
          her pain left... forever!
