        </h1>
        <p>
          Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802-1866) believed he healed just as
          Jesus did and proved it by successfully treating and healing
          approximately 38,000 patients. Most often his patients couldn't tell
          how they were cured because to them they just talked. This doesn't
          mean that Quimby himself was ignorant of what he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          What did Dr. Quimby actually do? He always started by simply sitting
          and chatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          They'd talk about the patient's problem(s). At some point, Dr. Quimby
          would explain that from his own experience, the initial cause of
          health problems came from a single opinion. He'd ask them to tell him
          what was going on in their life just before their trouble(s) started.
          Thereby he located what caused their condition.

        <p>
          Quimby never went into a trance. He wrote that his ability to heal
          contained four basic steps: 1.) His own experience, knowledge and good
          judgment, 2.) He understood the patient's state, 3.) He had developed
          the ability to find the opinion, the lie that led to their problem,
          and 4.) He knew how to guide them back to the truth. The truth is the
          cure!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it took multiple conversations to get the patient to change
          their mind. At others, it took only one chat. Once the patient changed
          their mind, a cure took place.

        <h2 class="center text-maroon">Quimby's Method - History</h2>
        <h3 class="center">38,000 Patients Cured of Incurable Diseases</h3>
        <p>
          Hundred's of newspaper articles and letters praise Dr. Quimby's method
          of treatment. Copies were donated to The Library of Congress for their
          historical value. Here are a few.
        </p>

        <h3>Bangor Jeffersonian Times - February 1858</h3>
        <p>
          Mrs. Hodson of Kenduskeag was sick with dyspepsia [disturbed
          digestion] in its worst form. For two years she was utterly
          prostrated, unable to walk a single step or be in an upright position
          without fainting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Quimby sat with her. In two hours she rose from her bed without
          assistance and seated herself in a chair. She was able to sit up for
          two hours without fainting. She steadily improved and in time gained a
          much needed twenty pounds of weight. All this came as the result of a
          single visit from Dr. Quimby.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have heard of other cases of remarkable relief. It is too late an
          hour for the cry of humbug in Dr. Quimby's treatment of disease.
          People are beginning to inquire, who is Dr. Quimby? By what strange
          agency does he cure disease which for years has baffled the skill of
          our most eminent physicians?
        </p>

        <h3>Evening Courier - September 1860</h3>
        <p>
          We have been told that the age of miracles has passed. But we have
          recently heard of several astonishing cures preformed by a Dr. P. P.
          Quimby which seem miraculous. How are these cures effected? It is
          impossible to say. There is no visible means employed. The most
          obstinate cases of disease disappear. It would seem they disappear by
          the mere will of Dr. Quimby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having heard of one such remarkable recovery, we called on the
          patient. She stated her circumstances and the manner of her cure. At
          our request, she sent us the following letter with the facts
          surrounding her recovery.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>Dear Sirs:</p>
        <p>
          I have been sick five years, with a great deal of pain in my back and
          limbs. It ap- peared to be caused by blue pills taken two years
          before. I was unable to walk, or even stand. For months I was
          prostrate upon my bed, confined to a dark room from neuralgia of my
          optic nerve. That plus painful dyspepsia made me sufferer even more.
          The doctors said that the blue pills had given me a disease of the
          spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          After two years in the care of my uncle and brother (both doctors)
          they decided medicine would not cure me. They took me to see a Water
          Cure physician in Hill, New Hampshire. That doctor concluded that
          there was no help for me; concluding that the spinal marrow was
          diseased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning of Dr. Quimby's success curing incurable diseases, we set out
          to see him. We arrived at the United States Hotel in Portland, Maine
          on the morning of August 15th. Seated in my wheel chair my uncle and
          brother carried me up the hotel stairs to my room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifteen minutes after I saw Dr. Quimby, I was walking. I went down
          stairs without as- sistance for dinner. Again without assistance, I
          climbed the stairs to my room. That evening, I took a long walk of
          about forty steps with assistance. I was wild with delight. I was like
          one risen from the dead. The next day I walked down the street for a
          mile. On the sixth day after seeing Dr. Quimby I walked four and a
          half miles. In less than two weeks I walked eight miles, four mile to
          Portland from Falmouth and back again.
        </p>
        <p>
          My disease is entirely gone, my back is perfectly well. I have no
          fears of a relapse.
        </p>
        <p>Yours with much esteem,</p>
        <p>F. C. B. - Williamstown, Vermont.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          To this testimony we add that of Mr. Julius Dresser, who was restored
          to health by Dr. Quimby three months before. Since that time he has
          devoted himself to conversing with patients who were able to see Dr.
          Quimby and be cured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Dresser saw Miss B. in her invalid condition, then walked and
          talked with her during some of her walks mentioned above. He learned
          the facts of her situation first hand and saws that she was restored
          to health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if this were a solitary case we might ascribe the cure to the
          imagination, as it is well know that imagination has worked wonders in
          this way. But this is but one of a number of equally remarkable cases
          which have occurred here. Many witnesses stand ready to bear testimony
          to the facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          One lady severely afflicted with rheumatism was bent nearly double. A
          perfect cripple, unable to use her hands or feet. In a short time she
          was restored to health. She is a living, working evidence of the
          Doctor's skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          A gentlemen, a friend of ours, had for years been afflicted with
          severe hip pain. For a long time he'd been confined to his bed. His
          physicians had given up. They told is wife that he would only live a
          few more days. His wife proposed calling in Dr. Quimby. He objected
          strenuously. He was bitterly opposed to anything like 'humbuggery'. He
          considered Quimby "one of the biggest humbugs". But, his wife insisted
          on calling in Dr. Quimby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Quimby visited him and yesterday we met the patient on the street.
          He was walking home to dinner. He looked heartier than we have seen
          him for a long time. He considers himself entirely cured of the hip
          pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we mentioned that people considered these cures humbugs. "So did
          I. But here I am. If humbug can work such wonders, Glory Be to humbug,
          say I." And so say we!
        </p>
        <p>
          We might cite a dozen other cases, but we refrain. We have no other
          motive in mentioning these rare cures than to make our readers aware
          of this remarkable phenomena. We have but a slight acquaintance with
          Dr. Quimby and have no interest in publicizing his astonishing cures
          to the world in order to make him famous. We have mentioned the cures
          as a matter of curious speculation. We must confess there is something
          about them more than our philosophy ever dreamed.
        </p>

        <h3>Free Press - Lebanon, New Hampshire 1856</h3>
        <p>
          Just at present time there is a good deal to say about Dr. Quimby of
          Portland, ME. We would considered it amiss to not mention the case of
          a young lady of this town who has greatly benefited by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For nearly three years she had been an invalid-- a great part of that
          time she was confined to bed. She was unable to leave her room unless
          she was carried out. She heard of Dr. Quimby and resolved to visit him
          in Maine. She did so. After remaining under his care for four days she
          returned home free from all pain and disease. She is now rapidly
          regaining her health and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reputation of Dr. Quimby as a man who cures diseases has extended.
          The increasing respect and confidence in his success would suggest
          that it's a time of miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          He effects his cures without the aid of medicine or outward
          applications. His practice embraces cases like above, where all
          ordinary treatment has failed to relieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible in a brief communication to do anything like justice
          to Dr. Quimby. Enough has been said and done to separate him from
          quacks and imposters. The case cited above is not a solitary instance
          of his skill in practicing his method. His increasing popularity with
          all classes shows that the confidence of the public has not been
          misplaced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having heard that Quimby had restored a woman who had been speechless.
          The patient being a daughter of Capt. Blodgett of Brooksville.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been suddenly deprived of her speech two years before. No
          cause for her inability to talk was known. She had not been sick, nor
          had any trouble of mind or body known to have produced the
          speechlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          One evening her speech was observed to be slightly impaired. She
          retired as usual and on waking in the morning she was utterly
          speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          From then she had not uttered an audible word. One physician
          attributed the cause to a sort of paralysis of the vocal organs. The
          best medical aid had been sought to no avail.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to Dr. Quimby, she is now in full possession of her voice.</p>

          Quimby's Method<br />
          Now in Use Going On 44 Years
        </h2>
        <p>
          For over twenty years I had helped the public recover with the use of
          my intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1997 I discovered that my healing methods were not as effective as
          I had thought. Physically I had spiraled down. I couldn't figure out
          what was caused the pain in my muscles, abdomen, and back. I was weak
          and tired. It was painful to be touched. Within a few weeks I was
          bedridden. I finally gave in and went to see a medical doctor. His
          diagnosis: Fibromyalgia, a disease that had no known cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unexpectedly one day, it occurred to me that a cure was not going to
          be found in medicine or alternative medicines. Why? Because both
          medicine and alternative medicine researchers had been working to find
          a cure for Fibromyalgia for over 80 years... and failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reasoned that after 80 years of research, they were not going to
          find a cure. I decided that the researchers must be looking in the
          wrong place. I decided that there must be a cure as I wasn't born with
          it... that something must have changed. I reasoned that If I could
          find out what I'd changed, there just might be a way to reverse it. I
          decide to do my own research. The only place I knew to look that was
          beyond medicine and alternative research was the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within a few days of making those decisions, there was a knock on my
          door. I opened it to find Mark and Mary on my porch with an invitation
          to their church. That particular day my symptoms were running rampant.
          I was exhausted and in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I asked them to feel free come back another day when I felt better. I
          explained that I had Fibromyalgia and the symptoms made me too tired
          to visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they turned to leave I over-heard Mark remark to Mary, “It's too
          bad she can't see Dr. Quimby. He'd probably have had a cure for
          Fibromyalgia.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark's remark stayed with me. I decided I was going to find the doctor
          he mentioned. No matter how much money it took or how far I'd have to
          travel, I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          A week later Mark came to see if there was anything the church could
          do for me. I invited him in. Once seated, I explained that I'd
          over-heard him say that there's a doctor who cured incurable diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine the blow I took when he told me that the doctor he was
          referring to Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby had been dead for nearly 120
          years. He added that he'd read newspapers articles about him. That he
          had healed over 38,000 of their incurable diseases using his method.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second blow came when he told me that his patients couldn't tell
          how he'd cured them. And, that Quimby left no explanation behind on
          how he did healed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following day Mark stopped by with a gift... the Quimby
          Manuscripts a 1921 out-of-print book. He told me that he'd purchased
          it at a garage sale but never read it... that he wasn't interested in
          it. Each time he moved, the book came with him. He added that he still
          couldn't figure out why he bought it in the first place, unless it was
          for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After he left, I casually flipped through the 440 pages and found a
          Quimby Quote.
          <i
            >"The cause of all disease, all discomfort is an opinion the patient
            believes about themselves."</i
          >
          Elsewhere in the book I found that
          <i
            >"an opinion is someone's belief but it's not based on facts, that
            it's most likely something someone made up."</i
          >
          Although at the time I didn't fully understand what he meant, the
          phrases stayed with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that Dr. Quimby didn't leave us how he healed. I diligently
          studied that book for months looking for clues. Each time I came
          across a point that might be one of the steps he used I wrote it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quimby started each new patient consultation by simply sitting and
          talking. He explained that he felt that the true cause of their
          problem was merely having unknowingly made a decision based upon
          someone's opinion. He followed that by asking them to describe their
          current symptoms and when and how they started; to remember what was
          going on in their life that they did not like when their first symptom
          started. Gradually he was able locate their opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persuaded that the opinion was somehow a lie, a mistake, the patient
          usually, on their own, would change their mind. And, the cure took
          place.
        </p>

        <h2 class="center text-maroon">How Conversation Can Cause a Cure</h2>
        <p>
          Suppose a man saw on the news an account of an airliner crashing on
          take-off leav- ing no survivors. Knowing that his son was supposed to
          be on that flight, he assumes his son is dead. Hormones would kick in.
          The shock would cause grief, a deep feeling of sorrow and chest pain.
          He not only has mental anguish but physical pain as well. In that
          moment, what is his condition? Does he imagine his suffering? His
          chest pain? Is it real? Of course, it's real. Is his body affected?
          Yes, it is. Does he have actual physical symptoms of a sick person?
          Yes, he does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose you were sent to see this father to tell him that you were
          with his son when the plane crashed... That you both missed the
          flight. His son, being a doctor was needed at the hospital so he
          changed his plans. "Proof" that the report of his son's death was in
          error, that he's alive and well long after the crash... what follows?
          Why, the parent undergoes an immediate change, as does his body. He is
          no longer sick or in pain.

        </div>

        <p>
          After months of study to figure out how Quimby healed, I had what I
          thought was his step-by-step procedure. I tried it on friends and
          family... and failed sixteen times. Each time tried I did think that I
          had Quimby's method down pat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time I failed, I did not give up. I went back to studying The
          Quimby Manuscripts and modified my steps.

          My First Successful Healing With Quimby's Method
        </h2>
        <h3>Tony</h3>
        <p>
          My 17th attempt was Tony, a friend of a friend. He'd learned what I
          was attempting and called to see if he could be one of my 'guinea
          pigs'. (His words not mine.) Tony was a disabled construction worker.
          We met at his mother's house as her house was between ours. (I had yet
          to learn that I could do Quimby's Method over the phone.)
        </p>
        <p>
          About three years earlier, within a few days of each other he was in
          two serious car accidents and ruptured multiple discs in his low back.
          Since then he'd been in horrendous pain. Five years of pain had robbed
          him of his youth and his ability to support his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day of our appointment I stood on the porch, watching him. His
          posture was stooped. In his early thirties, he looked to be a feeble
          80 years old man. He walked slowly, using extreme care not to jar
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took him fifteen minutes to climb up the five stairs to the porch.
          As he lifted his foot to the first stair, he looked up and explained
          that he had to be sure not to jar his spine as he put his foot down.
          He used the banister slowly pulling himself up from one step to the
          next.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was another ten minutes before we reached the den and closed the
          door. After some small talk, I was ready to start. I ask him to
          remember what was going on in his life before his first accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been so many years now that I don't remember the exact decision
          he made that caused the injuries to his back. I only remember that it
          had something to do with a horse or horses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three hours later bouncing with exuberance Tony walked out and stunned
          his mom. Even though told what to expect if it worked, she didn't
          believe he could be healed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulsating with excitement he gathered his tiny, speechless mom up into
          his arms and whirled her around. Laughingly, repeating over and over
          "I'm back!", "I'm back!", "I'm really back!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "He not only looks his age, he's glowing!" said his tearful mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          What caused Tony's pain? According to his doctors and x-rays, he had
          three ruptured discs. According to Quimby's Method, he believed a
          series of opinions. That one 3 hour session was all he needed. His
          pain never returned.
        </p>

        <h2 class="center text-maroon">
          Sixteen Failures Become <br />
          Sixteen Triumphs
        </h2>
        <p>
          One at a time I called each of my sixteen failures and explained the
          success I had with Tony, that I thought that I had the right
          step-by-step sequence. Then I asked each if they'd be willing to let
          me try again. The "Yes!" was unanimous. Using the same step-by-step
          procedure I'd used on Tony, each one of the sixteen recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second healing using Quimby's Method was on myself. After 9 months
          of studying and plus four hours of sessions all my Fibromyalgia
          symptoms left.
        </p>

        <h3>The Energy - with Quimby's Method</h3>
        <p>
          Lydia Foster was the fifth person to experience Quimby's Method. She
          invited me to be her house guest and do Quimby's Method. I'd not yet
          learned that Quimby's Method could be done over the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lydia was in practice as a Chiropractor, when she was diagnosed with
          Epstein-Barr Virus and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For five long years,
          she lived as an invalid. On a 'good day' she managed one hour out of
          bed. Immediately after her first session using Quimby's method, Lydia
          was able to be up for an additional five hours.
        </p>
        <p>I asked Lydia for the following letter.</p>
        <p>
          "I feel fantastic! My life has never been this good. My health has
          completely returned. On my 56th birthday two weeks ago, I took a
          sixteen-mile hike, up-hill! I did not get tired. A few days before
          that hike, I had two days with a shovel, digging a drainage ditch. I
          thought for sure that I would be sore the next day. I wasn't, not one
          muscle was sore."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I asked Sarah to continue doing sessions until all my opinions were
          gone. What I did not share with her was that I was also a manic
          depressive. In Psychiatry a manic depressive illness is considered an
          affective disorder marked by alternating episodes of mania and
          depression. It's sometimes called bipolar disorder or a bipolar
          illness. That took a little longer to remove; six months of phone
          sessions to be exact. It's now been over 2 years and I am still free
          of symptoms. I love the new me."
        </p>
        <h3>Sarah</h3>
        <p>
          On our first day Lydia spent the entire day on the couch. Three
          mornings later, she was cleaning and moving furniture. On the sixth
          day she told me everything had been cleaned but the guest room. She
          asked if I would mind if she cleared it out and moved the furniture
          around. In the evening, I found her lifting and wiping under plates
          she had stored in her pantry. She complained of the energy and wanted
          to know when or if it would slow down.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took about eight phone sessions to remove the opinions she had on
          Chronic Fatigue and Epstein-Barr. It was ten sessions to eliminate
          manic depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her second year of health, she had a flare-up. With forty minutes,
          we were able to re-establish her health.
        </p>

        <div class="section-seperator">

        </div>

        <p>
          There have been occasions when an individual's decision to believe
          something that wasn't true was uncovered and removed within a few
          hours. Normally before an illness or injury can be cured, there are
          numerous bad opinions to find and remove. To be cured each one of
          those must be found and removed.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Jane</h3>
        <p>
          Jane had severe, low back pain for well over five years and was unable
          to work. She could no longer do many of the things she loved. Jane was
          both pale and worried. She was doubtful that we'd get rid of her pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her session lasted only an hour. Rather quickly we found the decision
          causing her pain. Without prompting, she knew that the decision she'd
          made wasn't true. Without help from me, she knew the truth. Instantly
          her pain left... forever!

          Phineas Parkhurst Quimby <br />
          <small>BIOGRAPHY</small> <br />
          <small>HIS HEALING METHOD DISCOVERED</small>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, known as "Park," was born on February 16,
          1802 in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He was apprenticed out quite young as
          a clock-maker with little traditional education.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first important milestone in his life was the result of a serious
          bacterial disease, tuberculosis. Disillusioned by the treatments
          prescribed by his doctor, he gave up hope of recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          A friend suggested that as a way to improve his condition he might
          take up horseback riding as a physical, outdoor activity. While his
          severe physical ailment prevented him from even trying horseback
          riding, he tried the next best thing. He embarked on carriage trips.
          The carriage rides produced remarkable results. At first slowly, then
          more rapidly, he began to feel better. In time he recovered without
          antibotics.
        </p>
        <p>
          His recovery prompted a lot of curiosity. In 1838, Quimby studied
          Mesmerism. By the conclusions of his studies in 1859, he had connect
          his own experience recovering from tuberculosis and the placebo effect
          he experienced from his outdoor exercise. He understood how his
          decisions created both the tuberculosis and his recovery. He opened an
          office in Portland, Maine to share his mental healing ideas with
          others who suffered from an incurable disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 16, 1866 at the age of sixty-four years, Dr. Quimby died.
          His cause of death was noted as Exhaustion.
        </p>
        <p>
          He left articles, notes and patient files... But no step-by-step
          instructions as to how he healed his patients.
